# Ansible & Docker Introduction

**Ansible**
    Ansible is an automation engine that automates software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment.

**Docker**
    Docker provides an additional layer of abstraction and automation of operating-system-level virtualization on Windows, Mac os and Linux. Docker uses the resource isolation features of the Linux kernel such as cgroups and kernel namespaces, and a union-capable file system such as OverlayFS and others to allow independent "containers" to run within a single Linux instance, avoiding the overhead of starting and maintaining virtual machines.

**Both are open source**
